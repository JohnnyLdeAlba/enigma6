# Enigma 6 Content Manager

An unfinished concept from 2014 for a content manager that was writted in Python and used a MySQL database. This was for a video game website called Gaming Rebellion that had a team of writers who contributed articles to the website. This was intended to replace the existing WordPress system that the website was using before.
